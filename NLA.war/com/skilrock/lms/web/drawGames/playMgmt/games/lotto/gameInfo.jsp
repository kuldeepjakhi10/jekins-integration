							FLORIDA LOTTO With XTRA® gives FLORIDA LOTTO players "multiple"
							reasons to play! Similar to POWERBALL® with Power Play®, FLORIDA
							LOTTO with XTRA offers players the opportunity to multiply their
							non-jackpot cash winnings by two, three, four or five times for
							just $1 more per play. New FLORIDA LOTTO playslips are now
							available at authorized Florida Lottery <s:property value="#application.TIER_MAP.RETAILER" />s statewide.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each playslip contains 10 panels (A-J), allowing you to play up
							to 10 plays per drawing (one play per panel). In each panel:
						</p>
						<p>
							1. Select six numbers from 1 through 53, or mark the QP (Quick
							Pick) box and let the terminal randomly pick some or all of your
							numbers.
						</p>
						<p>
							2. To multiply your winnings on non-jackpot cash prizes, select
							the XTRA box. XTRA costs $1 more per play. FLORIDA LOTTO tickets
							will display "XTRA YES" if you add XTRA to your LOTTO purchase.
							Please Note: The XTRA box applies to all panels, Advance Plays
							and Quick Picks played on the playslip.
						</p>
						<p>
							3. To play the same numbers for more than one draw, simply tell
							the <s:property value="#application.TIER_MAP.RETAILER" /> how many advance draws you wish to play or select
							the number of draws you want to play in the Advance Play section
							of your playslip. For more information on Advance Play, please
							click here.
						</p>
						<p>
							4. Give your completed playslip and payment to the <s:property value="#application.TIER_MAP.RETAILER" />. You
							will receive a ticket printed with your numbers, draw date(s) and
							the value of each panel played. Please check your ticket before
							you leave the store. You are responsible for the accuracy of your
							ticket.
						</p>
						<p>
							5. Check the official drawing results to see if you're a winner!
							Draw results are available on this Web site, at authorized
							Florida Lottery <s:property value="#application.TIER_MAP.RETAILER" />s and by calling (850) 921-PLAY (7529).To
							watch the drawings, click here.
						</p>
						<p>
							Drawings are held Wednesday and Saturday nights at 11:15 p.m.,
							Eastern Time. Tickets may be purchased until 10:40 p.m., Eastern
							Time, on the night of the draw. Tickets purchased after 10:40
							p.m. will be for the next draw.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you claim a prize on a winning Advance Play ticket before all
							of the draws on the ticket have occurred, you will be issued a
							continuation ticket for the remaining draws with the same play
							numbers as the original ticket.

							XTRA is a special feature that allows players to multiply their
							non-jackpot cash prizes by two, three, four or five times the
							original prize amount! A player must choose the XTRA option on
							his/her FLORIDA LOTTO playslip or tell the <s:property value="#application.TIER_MAP.RETAILER" /> that he/she
							wishes to purchase a FLORIDA LOTTO with XTRA ticket. FLORIDA
							LOTTO with XTRA tickets cost an additional $1 per play.
						</p>
						<p>
							For a limited time, FLORIDA LOTTO with XTRA players who match
							three of six winning numbers will win a minimum of $25, the
							3-of-6 prize multiplied by five, regardless of the multiplier
							selected for that drawing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Prizes shown are estimated prize amounts. All cash prizes are
							pari-mutuel. The XTRA number, from 2 to 5, will be drawn at
							random just before the FLORIDA LOTTO drawing to determine how
							much the non-jackpot cash prizes will be increased for that draw.
						</p>
						<p>
							* For a limited time, the XTRA 3-of-6 prize will pay a minimum of
							$25 (5 times the FLORIDA LOTTO base prize.)
						</p>
						<p>
							** For FLORIDA LOTTO with XTRA players, the odds of matching 2 of
							6 numbers are 1 in 8.58. The XTRA 2-of-6 prize is a free FLORIDA
							LOTTO with XTRA Quick Pick ticket for the next available draw.

							The Florida Lottery will hold official FLORIDA LOTTO drawings
							where six out of 53 numbers will be drawn at random. If your six
							numbers match the six winning numbers drawn in the official
							drawing for the date played, you win a FLORIDA LOTTO jackpot.
							Match three, four or five of the winning numbers to win other
							cash prizes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The XTRA multiplier number is selected at random, from 2 through
							5, before each drawing. If a FLORIDA LOTTO with XTRA player
							matches three, four or five winning numbers, he/she wins an
							amount equal to the original prize amount multiplied by the
							multiplier that was drawn before the drawing. If the player
							matches just two winning numbers, he/she wins a free FLORIDA
							LOTTO with XTRA ticket for the next available draw.
						</p>
						<p>
							Players may choose to receive their portion of the FLORIDA LOTTO
							jackpots in a one-time Cash Option payment or in 30 annual
							payments. The Cash Option payment is the amount required on the
							day of the drawing (or if the drawing is held on a Saturday or
							holiday, the business day prior to the drawing) to fund the
							applicable jackpot prize paid over 30 years, less applicable
							taxes.
